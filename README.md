# Eye-Controlled-Mouse
The Eye-Controlled Mouse Python Project is an innovative and assistive technology endeavor that aims to empower individuals with motor disabilities or conditions that limit their ability to use traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard. This project leverages computer vision and eye-tracking technology to enable users to control the computer cursor using their eye movements, providing a hands-free and intuitive interface.

Key Features:
1) Eye Tracking: The project employs computer vision algorithms to process real-time video input from a camera, allowing the system to accurately track the user's eye movements. Sophisticated image processing techniques are used to identify and interpret eye position and gaze direction.

2) Calibration: The system includes a calibration process during the initial setup, where the user is guided through a series of visual stimuli to establish a personalized eye-tracking profile. This step is crucial to ensure accurate and customized control for each individual user.

3) Cursor Control: Once calibrated, the eye-controlled mouse accurately maps the user's eye movements to control the computer cursor's position on the screen. By gazing at specific regions or performing predefined eye gestures, the user can perform cursor movements, clicks, and other interactions.

4) User Interface: The project incorporates a user-friendly graphical interface that displays the real-time eye tracking data and calibration progress. The interface allows users to adjust sensitivity, switch between modes, and calibrate as needed, ensuring a comfortable and adaptable user experience.

5) Machine Learning (Optional): To improve accuracy and user experience, the project may incorporate machine learning techniques. This allows the system to adapt and learn from the user's gaze behavior over time, making the eye-controlled mouse more intuitive and precise.

6) Compatibility: The project is designed to be platform-independent and can be integrated into various operating systems. It supports popular programming libraries for eye-tracking and computer vision, making it adaptable to different hardware setups and configurations.
